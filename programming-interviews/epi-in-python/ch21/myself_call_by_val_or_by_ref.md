# call by value & call by reference summary
* C -> call by value (because address is a kind of value)
* C++ -> call by value and call by reference
  - call by value in C++ is the same as in C
  - call by reference is an alias for the same memory address (the same box with different names). It would not consume another memory to save the address value (put the address value of the target box into another box.)
* Java -> call by value (because address is a kind of value)
* JavaScript -> call by value (because address is a kind of value)
* Python -> call by reference. It is an object reference implemented by something like pointers in C. You can refer to the page 177 of the book "Learning Python 5th" (O'Reily) by Mark Lutz
* Note that the word "reference" has different meaning in different language context.
