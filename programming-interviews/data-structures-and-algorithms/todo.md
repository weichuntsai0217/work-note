* Common sequence(array/singly-linked list) operations
  - Rotate a sequence with given shift
    1. not in place
    2. in place
  - Remove duplicates in a sequence
    1. the sequence is sorted.
    2. the sequence is not sorted.
  - Merge two sorted sequence
  - Reverse a sequence with given start and end index
  - Check if a sequence is palidromic with given start and end index
  - Pivot a sequence
  - Check is a singly-linked list cyclic

* heap
* data structures in Cormen's book and EPI in Python
* LRU cache with doubly-linked list
* hash
* RSA, encryption
* database
* string pattern matching
* need to know python's built-in type and `functools` implement and time complexity.
* regular expression

* basic computer structures (how a cpu exucutes +-x/, 2's complement, how integers be represented as bits? common bitwise operations)

* 3 examples for all data structures (examples on web/javascript application first)

* system programming/parallel computing (locks related, cpu scheduling, network socket)

* distributed system design
