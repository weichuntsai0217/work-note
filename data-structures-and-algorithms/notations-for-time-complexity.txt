# Notations for Time Complexity
* Theta notation refers to the lower bound and upper bound of the time complexity of an algorithm.
For example, the time complexity is theta of n^2.

* Big-O notation refers to the upper bound of the time complexity of an algorithm.
For example, the time complexity is big-O of n^2.

* Omega notation refers to the lower bound of the time complexity of an algorithm.
For example, the time complexity is omega of n^2.
