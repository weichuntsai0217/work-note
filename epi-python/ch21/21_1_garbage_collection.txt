# What is garbage collection?
Garbage collection is the process of finding data objects in a running program
that cannot be accessed in the future, and then to reclaim the resouces, particularly memory
used by those objects.

# What is a garbage-collected language?
A garbage-collected language is one language in which the garbage collection happens automatically.

# Give some examples about garbage-collected languages and nongarbage-collected languages.
Garbage-collected languages: Java, C#, JavaScript, Python, and most scripting language.
Nongarbage-collected: C

# Do you know some common strategies for garbage collection?
There are 2 common strategies:
1. reference counting
2. tracing

# Compare pros and cons for reference counting and tracing.
1. https://www.quora.com/How-do-reference-counting-and-garbage-collection-compare
2. refer to page 346 of EPI in python

# The challenge of implement reference counting and tracing.
1. The challenge of implement reference counting is "reference cycles", that is, objects A and B
reference each other, for example, A.u = B and B.v = A. The reference count never drops below 1.

2. The challenge of implementing tracing... (TBD)
